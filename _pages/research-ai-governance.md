## <i class="fas fa-robot"></i> AI Governance & Agentic Systems

Artificial Intelligence is transitioning from passive tools (Chatbots) to **active agents** capable of autonomous decision-making. My research focuses on the **governance frameworks** required to manage this shift, ensuring that *Agentic AI* systems remain aligned with human sovereignty and democratic values.

## 🧠 Core Research Themes

1.  **Agentic AI Frameworks**: Moving beyond "human-in-the-loop" to "human-on-the-loop" governance for autonomous systems.
2.  **Cognitive Sovereignty**: Protecting the "Sixth Domain" (the human mind) from algorithmic manipulation and cognitive warfare.
3.  **Sovereign AI Infrastructure**: Why nations must build their own "AI stacks" to maintain geopolitical independence.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **What is 'Agentic AI'?**
**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can pursue complex goals with limited human supervision. Unlike ChatGPT (which waits for a prompt), an Agentic AI can plan, execute, and adapt its actions to achieve an objective, essentially acting as an autonomous worker.

### **Why is 'Cognitive Sovereignty' important?**
As AI systems become better at persuasion and psychological profiling, the human mind becomes a "battlefield." **Cognitive Sovereignty** is the right of individuals and nations to protect their mental independence from covert algorithmic influence or "cognitive warfare."

### **How does Fractal Geometry apply to AI?**
Fractal descriptors help us model complex, chaotic systems—like the spread of disinformation or the behavior of neural networks. By filtering data through fractal mathematics, we can detect patterns of manipulation that standard linear models miss.
